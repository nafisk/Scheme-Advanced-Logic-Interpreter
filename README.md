### Part 1

Design a data type suitable for representing infix propositions, as described in my notes for Class 19.

Give a complete specification and development (including a proof) for a program which inputs a proposition
which uses and (^), or (v), not (-) and implies (=>) and which returns a logically equivalent proposition
using just ^ and - .  Both the input and output should use infix notation.

<!-- The lecture given on Tuesday, May 3, will be helpful in completing this assignment. -->

### Part 2

Give a complete specification and development (including proof) for an interpreter of infix propositions:
your interpreter will input a proposition and an a-list of T,F values for variables, and will return the
computed value of the input proposition using those values for its variables.

<!-- Lectures given on Thursday, May 5, and Tuesday, May 10, will be helpful in completing Part 2. -->

### Part 3

Demonstrate your interpreter by using it in conjunction with the front-end of Part 1.
